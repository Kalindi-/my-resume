HERE IS MY RESUME

===============


Here is my resume that I built as part of project 2 for Udacity'S Front End Nanodegree.

It can be found on **http://kalindi-f.appspot.com/**

Format and style guidelines:
--------------
A format on how to make this was provided from Udacity, (helper.js and some examples in resumeBuilder.js), which gave a way in which to construct the resume. I have the feeling some code does not fit with Udacity's style guidlines which made me a bit counfused about what and how to do (for example the id and class names: text-name vs textName;), as well as for exampel class white-text, because it is almost like inline css.
So maybe if I did it once again from the beginning I'd give up the given structure, and make one more fitting to my needs, but as an excercise it was quite interesting, and I think I learned quite some on the way: some jquery and some html manipulation as well as some javascript.


Google maps and markers:
--------------
Given that I wanted many many markers on my map, I went to research ways to do so, and then decided to use the marker manager.
Looking for coordinates given a place at each page load is an intensive process, and this is why I wrote find_coordinates.py to add the coordinates into the resumeBuilder files. The js_locations_save, holds the resumeBuilders in different stages of completion, first with all coordinate values to be filled, second with places that got wrong coordinates better written.
